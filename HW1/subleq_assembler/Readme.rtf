Subleq assembler

	sqasm.exe < hw.sq > hw

will read hw.sq file and produce hw text file. If hw.sq is the first "hello world" example, the command also prints "UNRESOLVED: [OUT:4]" which tells that label OUT was not resolved - it is OK because OUT is the default name for the output register for the emulator.
